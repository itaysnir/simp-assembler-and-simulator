# simp-assembler-and-simulator
This project simulates a SIMP processor. 

It contains an assembler written in C, which translates the project's assembly into machine code. 
It also contains a processor simulator, simulates the fetch-decode-execute-writeback loop.  

Also, few program tests are added.
